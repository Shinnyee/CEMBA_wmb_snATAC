** CEMBA_wmb_snATAC
This repository is used for the whole mouse brain snATAC seq analysis
of Center for Epigenomics of the Mouse Brain Atlas (CEMBA). 

** Pipeline
    - We now have 234 samples and 2.3 million cells in total. So most
      of the analysis are depend on *Snakefile* to organize the pipeline
      and submit them to high-performance cluster (HPC) in order to
      use hundreds of CPUs at the same time.
    - R, Shell and Python are mainly used, especially R (version 4.2).
    - Under the directory [[./package][package]], we put lots of common functions there.

** Resources
    - We mainly use SnapATAC to analyze the single-nucleus ATAC-seq data
      - We maintain a bug-fix version of SnapATAC: https://github.com/beyondpie/SnapATAC
        - The original SnapATAC: https://github.com/r3fang/SnapATAC
      - There is an updated SnapATAC2: https://github.com/kaizhang/SnapATAC2
        - This is much powerful version, and we are working on using
          SnapATAC2 to re-analyze the data, and once we've done that,
          we will push our scripts to the current repo, too.
    - Comparation between Scrublet and AMULET: https://github.com/yuelaiwang/CEMBA_AMULET_Scrublet 
    - The peak calling pipeline and NMF analysis are mainly from: https://github.com/yal054/snATACutils
    - The deep learning related codes now in the repo:  https://github.com/yal054/mba_dl_model
      - We plan to merge those codes to this repo soon.
    
** NOTE
   - We here put majority analysis of CEMBA whole mouse brain (wmb) by SnapATAC2
