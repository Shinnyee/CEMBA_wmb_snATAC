* CEMBA_wmb_snATAC
This repository is used for the whole mouse brain (wmb) snATAC-seq data analysis
of Center for Epigenomics of the Mouse Brain Atlas (CEMBA), which is now accepted by Nature 2023.

** Data
   

** Pipeline
    - We now have 234 samples and 2.3 million cells in total. So most
      of the analysis are depend on *Snakefile* to organize the pipeline
      and submit them to high-performance cluster (HPC) in order to
      use hundreds of CPUs at the same time.
    - R, Shell and Python are mainly used, especially R (version 4.2).
    - Under the directory [[./package][package]], we put lots of common functions there.
    - We mainly use [[https://github.com/kaizhang/SnapATAC2][SnapATAC2]] to analyze the single-nucleus ATAC-seq data
    - Comparation between Scrublet and AMULET: https://github.com/yuelaiwang/CEMBA_AMULET_Scrublet 
    - The deep learning related codes now in the repo: https://github.com/yal054/mba_dl_model

*** Clustering
    In total, we have implemented four-round iterative clustering.
    See details in [[file:17.snapatac2][17.snapatac2]]
*** Integration and annotation
    We use Allen's scRNAseq data and their annotations for our data annotation.
    See details in [[file:19.snap2_integration][19.snap2_integratio]]
*** Peak calling
   We use macs2 with multiple stage filtering, especially use SPM >= 5
   for filtering peaks.
   See details in [[file:18.snap2_peakcalling][18.snap2_peakcalling]]
*** PBS TORQUE
    In order to better support pbs torque in tscc, please
    - =mkdir -p ~/.config/snakemake=
    - then =cp -r /projects/ps-renlab2/szu/projects/CEMBA2/package/pbs-torque-conda ~/.config/snakemake/=
    - then go to the pbs-torque-conda directory you copy,
      1. modify config.yaml: replace szu to your name and corresponding conda path
      2. modify submit.yaml: replace szu to your name
      3. modify pbs-submit.py: replace szu to your name
