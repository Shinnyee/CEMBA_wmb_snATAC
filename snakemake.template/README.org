* A general template for snakemake
We used [[https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake][snakemake]] to organize our pipeline for majority of the data
analysis. Here we provide one example Snakefile used for calling
cicero (part of the rules are selected and the config file is
modified).

** About snakefile
   1. We can basically treat it as a *Python* script with some
      /snakemake/ rules.
   2. It supports yaml file as a config file, and the parameters in
      this file will have lower priorities with the parameters
      directly claimed when calling snakemake with `--config
      param1=value1`. 
   3. It supports high-performance cluster (HPC) automatically.
