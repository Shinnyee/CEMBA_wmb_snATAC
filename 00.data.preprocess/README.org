* Quality Control and Doublet Removal
** Quality control
   - At bulk level, we check the quality of the sequencing based on
     the sequencing depth, number of unique fragments, and so on. The
     most important thing is to check if the size of fragments in each
     sample were enriched in 100 bp and 200 bp (see [[https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-1929-3][ref]]).
   - At single-cell level, we follow the
     [[https://www.encodeproject.org/atac-seq/][ENCODE pipeline]], we use two criteria to filter cells:
     1. Number of unique fragment >= 1,000
     2. Transcription start site enrichment (TSSe) >= 10
** Doublet removal
   - We use Scrublet for this. And the imputed gene expression from
     snATAC-seq data is similar like what Seurat did.
